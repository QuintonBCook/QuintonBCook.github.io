            <p>&emsp;A 4L60E transmission and a friend with a project car, that is where it all began. 
                He came to me with an idea, paddle shifters. 
                He really wanted to put paddle shifters on his car but the ones on the market were all over half a grand, so we built our own; or more accurately, I built them. 
                The transmission works by grounding two wires in a series. 
                First, I wrote the software, the hardest part of which was debouncing two buttons at once. 
                Then I make the physical parts, 3D modeling and printing a paddle apparatus to fit on his steering wheel as well as a box to put the electronics in. 
                Last was getting everything wired properly. 
                We used an Arduino nano, two relays, a buck boost converter, and two limit switches. 
                In the end it was a very simple process but through it I became certain of my decision to study computer and mechanical engineering.<br></p>
            <p>&emsp;Technology has always fascinated me. 
                The notion that electricity becomes an image boggled my mind. 
                For a long time, I thought I would never understand it, so I settled on becoming a mechanical engineer. 
                Then, in 2019, I found out just how easy, and fun, it was to work with programming. 
                However, knowing only how to program did not feel like enough, so I chose my degree plan accordingly. 
                I will work towards a B.A. of Computer Engineering, with a minor in mechanical engineering. 
                That way I will have what I feel are the three main engineering disciplines: computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.<br></p>
            <p>&emsp;Programming has always been my favorite part. 
                I get a certain rush when a program runs correctly that is simply put, amazing. 
                I love finding new innovative and inventive ways to solve problems with programming. 
                I spend most of my time learning new computer languages and their applications in the real world.</p>
