          <h1>Service Learning Project</h1>
          <p>The Canadian Independ School District recently hired a new technology teacher at their middle school. In prior the curriculum for this class included a 3D printing section. However, this new teacher had not ever word with CAD or 3D printers.<br>Quinton offered his services to teach the teacher the basics of both CAD and 3D printing. He did this by showing the teacher how to model a <em>maker coin</em> in Fusion 360. They then printed it out of PLA using a QiDi-XPlus 3D Printer.</p>
